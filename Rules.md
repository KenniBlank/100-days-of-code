# Rules of the 100 Days Of Code Challenge

## Main Commitment
### *I will code or learn about programming for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.*

#### Start Date
22 December 2024

## Challenge's Rule:
1. I will tweet about my progress every day -> using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode
2. I will push code and link to GitHub + X every day so that anyone can see my progress.
3. I will update the (Log)[log.md] with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.

## My self imposed Rules
1. I will not use any generative AI models during the 100 days.
2. Instead of making projects, I will be focusing on learning this round.
3. Daily Exercise (Twice if possible)
