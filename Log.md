### Day 0: December 22, 2024
**Today's Progress**: Joined the 100 Days of Code Challenge, got everything ready to start the challenge.

**Thoughts**: [Why I started this challenge!](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/birajtiwari_biraj-tiwari-birajtwr-on-x-activity-7276226926287990785-oVTN?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

### Day 001: December 23, 2024
**Today's Progress**: Started to learn Rust from its documentation website. Reached Chapter 4: Ownership. Created note for it 420 lines long for now.
Also started the book on algorithms: learned what NP-complete problem(travelling salesman problem), data structure, parallelism, etc is and why we require algorithms on this fast computer world. Later Implemented the insertion sort algorithm with rust which I got into a series of debugging after getting errors regarding negative usize data type. Read Up-to page 27. All of my notes on the book is written in spiral notebook because it is easier for me.

**Thoughts**: This is my second time starting rust. Before, I had to quit because I had other projects lined up that required my attention more (I feel like this is an excuse now because I could have spared thirty minutes). This time I plan to see it through. 
This time, I have started the book on the algorithms in earnest because I need the knowledge to back me up. I need this knowledge.
Without AI debugging the code that runs on all other languages but Rust, is tough. It took time. This shows how dependent I had gotten with AI for debugging. Its good that I am leaving AI's for a while.

### Day 2: December 24, 2024
**Today's Progress**: 
- Learned why RAM has stack and heap! (Researched in stack exhange + reddit + medium)
- Still learning about ownership in Rust, currently at reference and de-reference part of the book. 
- In algorithm book, reached merge sort. I tried to implement merge sort based on my understanding but Rust is giving me lots of compile time error. 
- Programmed for like 3 hours today (Just random things in Rust). I am learning to read rust's compile error better as I work with it.

**Thoughts**: I knew that things kept in stack was fast AF. So why doesn't OS keep everything in stack? Why is RAM divided when for efficiency we could use stack for everything!

Answer: every thread has own stack which is cleared after execution but heap is shared across all execution.  Stack is fast because of LIFO: latest execution is always the one computed the first and cleared.

I am slowly getting used to searching at stackoverflow for answers or writing my own question.
