### Day 0: December 21, 2024
**Today's Progress**: Joined the 100 Days of Code Challenge, got everything ready to start the challenge.

**Thoughts**: [Why I started this challenge!](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/birajtiwari_biraj-tiwari-birajtwr-on-x-activity-7276226926287990785-oVTN?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

### Day 001: December 22, 2024
**Today's Progress**: Started to learn Rust from its documentation website. Reached Chapter 4: Ownership. Created note for it 420 lines long for now.
Also started the book on algorithms: learned what NP-complete problem(travelling salesman problem), data structure, parallelism, etc is and why we require algorithms on this fast computer world. Later Implemented the insertion sort algorithm with rust which I got into a series of debugging after getting errors regarding negative usize data type. Read Up-to page 27. All of my notes on the book is written in spiral notebook because it is easier for me.

**Thoughts**: This is my second time starting rust. Before, I had to quit because I had other projects lined up that required my attention more (I feel like this is an excuse now because I could have spared thirty minutes). This time I plan to see it through. 
This time, I have started the book on the algorithms in earnest because I need the knowledge to back me up. I need this knowledge.
Without AI debugging the code that runs on all other languages but Rust, is tough. It took time. This shows how dependent I had gotten with AI for debugging. Its good that I am leaving AI's for a while.

### Day 2: December 23, 2024
**Today's Progress**: 
- Learned why RAM has stack and heap! (Researched in stack exhange + reddit + medium)
- Still learning about ownership in Rust, currently at reference and de-reference part of the book. 
- In algorithm book, reached merge sort. I tried to implement merge sort based on my understanding but Rust is giving me lots of compile time error. 
- Programmed for like 3 hours today (Just random things in Rust). I am learning to read rust's compile error better as I work with it.

**Thoughts**: I knew that things kept in stack was fast AF. So why doesn't OS keep everything in stack? Why is RAM divided when for efficiency we could use stack for everything!

Answer: every thread has own stack which is cleared after execution but heap is shared across all execution.  Stack is fast because of LIFO: latest execution is always the one computed the first and cleared.

I am slowly getting used to searching at stackoverflow for answers or writing my own question.

### Day 3: December 24
**Today's Progress**: Finally was able to implement the merge sort in rust after learning yesterday. Completed understanding rust's reference + borrow principles. Learned more on the time complexity of divide and conquer method of algorithms.

**Thoughts**: The electricity was out for most of the day so I was able to do very little.

### Day 4: December 25
**Today's Progres**: Today was a lazy day. Didn't learn much. In rust, still on ownership: it turns out that the book by brown university is much much longer that actual rust's docs.
Didn't touch the book on algorithm today due to holiday spirit 

**Thoughts**: I am learning a lot but the implementation on rust is very tough. The docs on rust that I was reading turns out to be significantly longer that the actual docs. Going forward, I will be sticking to the longer book but that makes me wonder the speed. 
Yesterday's got didn't seem to have been pushed to github so Oh shit...
Next week, I am going to start the full stack challenge so as to continue learning web development along this track.
Merry Christmas!

> I will be starting the full stack on day 7.

### Day 5: December 26
**Today's Progress**: Today I was able to complete chapter 2 of algorithm book. In Rust finally past ch 4.2. Learned in depth about merge sort and learned Horner's rule for polynomial evaluation. Also learned about combining algorithms for the best result.

**Thoughts**: Installed arch 5 times today yet not successful in restoring bluetooth or wifi or the audio server. Not going to change OS for the next 100 days for sure now. I am trying to implement merge + insertion sort, lets see tmr I guess.

### Day 6: December 27
**Today's Progres**: Today not a lot of progress, in rust still learning about ownership and borrowing. I am not goin to move past the topic until I have grasped it.
In learning algorithms, I am learning notations right now.

**Thoughts**: Not much actually, I am still researching my future down the road. Yo

### Day 7: December 28
**Today's Progress**: Today I am genuinly happy with my progress. I started a course on probability which I need knowledge on for a fellowship that I want to apply for. Finally started fullstack from fullstackopen. Currently, I have completed module 1 of the probability course and am on part-0 fundamentals of fullstack. I am learning new terms and now I have also decided to use unity to create a game of my own spending 1 to 2 hrs daily just for fun. I am going to be using unity 2023 version because I hate the new Input manager and new scripting changes.

**Thoughts**: I have finally decided on the track foreward in this 100 days of code challenge. Sure there will be few changes here and there but I am content with what I have accomplished today. I will continue to learn algorithms, rust, fullstack, game dev, mathematics, etc. I am reaching to all fields because I want to explore and because I have more that enough time right now. I am lucky in that regards. Hopefully my joy will last for the rest of the days. Bye!
