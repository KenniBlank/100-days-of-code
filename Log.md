### Day 0: December 11, 2024
**Today's Progress**: Joined the 100 Days of Code Challenge, got everything ready to start the challenge.

**Thoughts**: [Why I started this challenge!](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/birajtiwari_biraj-tiwari-birajtwr-on-x-activity-7276226926287990785-oVTN?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

### Day 001: December 12, 2024
**Today's Progress**: Started to learn Rust from its documentation website. Reached Chapter 4: Ownership. Created note for it 420 lines long for now.
Also started the book on algorithms: learned what NP-complete problem(travelling salesman problem), data structure, parallelism, etc is and why we require algorithms on this fast computer world. Later Implemented the insertion sort algorithm with rust which I got into a series of debugging after getting errors regarding negative usize data type. Read Up-to page 27.

**Thoughts**: This is my second time starting rust. Before, I had to quit because I had other projects lined up that required my attention more (I feel like this is an excuse now because I could have spared thirty minutes). This time I plan to see it through. 
This time, I have started the book on the algorithms in earnest because I need the knowledge to back me up. I need this knowledge.
Without AI debugging the code that runs on all other languages but Rust, is tough. It took time. This shows how dependent I had gotten with AI for debugging. Its good that I am leaving AI's for a while.
