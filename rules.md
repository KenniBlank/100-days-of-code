## Main Commitment
### *I will code or learn about programming for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.*

#### Start Date

## My self imposed Rules
0. I will not use any generative AI models during the 100 days.
1. I will tweet about my progress every day -> using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode
2. I will push code and link to GitHub + X every day so that anyone can see my progress.
3. I will update the (Log)[log.md] with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
4. Instead of making projects, I will be focusing on learning this round.
